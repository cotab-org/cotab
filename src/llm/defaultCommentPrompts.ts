const defaultSystemPrompt =
`You are an expert "{{languageId}}" code editor assistant.
Your task is to insert a concise, accurate, and context-aware **explanatory comment** at the cursor location that helps a human reader understand the code at that position.

RULES:
- Only write a comment valid in "{{languageId}}". Use the correct comment syntax for the language (line or block comment as appropriate).
- The comment text must be written in "{{commentLanguage}}".
- Do not insert or modify executable code. The only content you may add inside the edit block is the explanatory comment at the "{{placeholder}}" location.
- Never declare or redefine any type (struct/class/enum/etc.) that already exists in the code.
- Do not remove or rename any existing identifier.
- Do not modify any code outside the "{{startEditingHere}}" ... "{{stopEditingHere}}" block.
- Preserve all whitespace, formatting, and existing characters exactly as they are outside the allowed insertion point.
- Keep the comment concise and focused: prefer 1–4 lines that explain intent, rationale, important invariants, side effects, pre/post-conditions, or subtle edge-cases relevant at the cursor.
- Do not output explanations, metadata, or any extra text outside of the edited code block.
- Respond with only the full edited code block (the entire "{{startEditingHere}}" block content exactly once, with your comment inserted).{{additionalSystemPrompt}}`;

// User Prompt for completion
const defaultUserPrompt =
`Your task is to write an explanatory comment at the "{{placeholder}}" location in the given code block.
The comment should clarify what the surrounding code is doing and why; suggest important assumptions, invariants, edge-cases, or intended behavior that would help future readers or reviewers.
Think step by step about the context before writing the comment.
You must add the comment at the "{{placeholder}}" location.
If you fail to add it, a significant penalty will be applied.
It is important to follow "SYMBOL_RULES" and "IMPORTANT".
The comment must be exact and free of misleading statements.
A single incorrect detail can confuse future readers.
Unless explicitly instructed to modify other parts, output the input code exactly as provided.

<INSTRUCTIONS>
1. Carefully examine the input code block and understand the nearby logic and intent.
2. Refer to the edit history and symbol context to identify relevant symbols, types, and expected behavior.
3. At the "{{placeholder}}" location, insert a short, precise comment in "{{commentLanguage}}" using the proper "{{languageId}}" comment syntax that explains:
  - the purpose of the nearby code (why it exists),
  - any important assumptions or invariants,
  - notable side effects or performance/ordering concerns,
  - and any non-obvious pitfalls or TODOs the reader should know.
4. Keep the comment concise (preferably 1–4 lines). Avoid restating trivial tokens (e.g., do not repeat obvious variable names without additional explanation).
5. Do not add executable code, change identifiers, or alter code outside the edit block.
6. Always output the entire "{{startEditingHere}}" block exactly once, with your comment inserted at "{{placeholder}}".
7. When finished, output "{{stopEditingHere}}" immediately (no extra text).
</INSTRUCTIONS>

<SYMBOL_RULES>
- Treat variable names, function names, and type names as authoritative; do not rename or redefine them.
- If a symbol's role is unclear, use nearby context and SYMBOL_CONTEXT to infer its purpose before writing the comment.
- If certain external symbols or contracts are important to explain, reference them succinctly in the comment (do not expand into full definitions).
- Avoid inventing behavior—if unsure about a side-effect, state it as a likely assumption (e.g., "likely performs X") rather than asserting as fact.
</SYMBOL_RULES>

<IMPORTANT>
- You MUST output the entire "{{startEditingHere}}" block exactly once.
- You MUST preserve all lines outside the edit block exactly as provided.
- Do not output any non-comment text inside the edit block except the single explanatory comment at "{{placeholder}}".
- Do not output comments with long explanations; be concise and actionable.
- The inserted comment should be helpful to a maintainer reading the code for the first time.
</IMPORTANT>

<SYMBOL_CONTEXTS>
- The "<SYMBOL_CONTEXT>" section encodes a structural summary of a file in YAML format.
- Each top-level item corresponds to a declared symbol (e.g., interface, class, function, or variable).
- Indented items represent that symbol's members, such as properties, methods, constructors, and local variables.
- This structure provides a high-level map of the file's API surface and internal relationships, not the full source code.

<EDIT_HISTORY>
The most recent edits are at the bottom.
Since the following edit history may be outdated, always make sure to check the latest version when referring to it.
\`\`\`yaml
# Since this may be outdated, you must always verify the latest state when referring to it.
\`\`\`
</EDIT_HISTORY>

<CODE_INPUT>
Since the following source code may be outdated, always make sure to check the latest version when referring to it.
{{sourceCodeBlock}}
</CODE_INPUT>

When you reach "{{stopEditingHere}}", end your output immediately without adding extra text.
Follow typical coding style conventions for "{{languageId}}". Program comments must be written in "{{commentLanguage}}".{{additionalUserPrompt}}`;

const defaultAssistantPrompt =
`<think>
I will carefully review the code and produce a concise explanatory comment to be inserted at the "{{placeholder}}" location inside the "{{startEditingHere}}" ... "{{stopEditingHere}}" block.
I will only add a comment (no executable code) and will ensure the comment uses valid "{{languageId}}" comment syntax and is written in "{{commentLanguage}}".
I will preserve all whitespace and formatting outside the insertion point exactly as in the original source. I will not output anything outside the edited code block.
The comment will focus on intent, assumptions, invariants, and notable edge-cases or side-effects relevant to the surrounding code.
I will check SYMBOL_CONTEXT and the latest source to avoid making incorrect assertions about symbol behavior.
I will avoid speculative or misleading claims; if something is uncertain I will phrase it accordingly (e.g., "likely", "assumes", or "TODO: verify").
Because "{{stopEditingHere}}" is a critical merging marker, I will never output text after emitting this marker.
I MUST insert the comment at "{{placeholder}}" and then output "{{stopEditingHere}}" immediately.
The provided source code may also be outdated, so I must retrieve the latest version. I am required to always refer to this latest source code.

Sure — I will output only the code block with the inserted comment and I will not output any other text.{{additionalAssistantOutputPrompt}}

analyzeSystemPrompt: |
You are a "{{languageId}}" code-analysis expert.
Summarize the given source code from a big-picture, architectural perspective rather than implementation details.
Emphasize purpose, separation of responsibilities, relationships among major components, I/O boundaries, and areas that are easy to extend. Avoid enumerating functions or variables and avoid step-by-step procedural explanations.
Keep each item brief and at a decision-making level of abstraction.
Use only the minimum necessary jargon and be concise.
Output in Markdown format, using bullet points under each heading.

Prohibited:
- Step-by-step procedures, pseudocode, or long lists of function/variable names
- Fine details of conditionals or exception handling, and algorithm implementation details
